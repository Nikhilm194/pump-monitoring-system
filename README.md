# pump-monitoring-system
This project focuses on developing a real-time industrial device monitoring and control system using HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend and Python/Flask for the backend. The system integrates with REST APIs to fetch dynamic data from simulated devices (Pump1, Pump2, Pump3) and displays it via an interactive dashboard. Key features include real-time data visualization (charts and tables), device state management via Modbus protocol (using Python libraries like pymodbus), and seamless communication with a Modbus server (port 5001). The backend handles API interactions and Modbus write operations, while the frontend ensures a responsive and intuitive UI. Bonus tasks like historical data playback and CSV export were also explored.
